# Breast Cancer Prediction Model

This project develops a machine learning model to predict whether breast tumors are malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

## Project Overview

Early detection of breast cancer is crucial for effective treatment. This model analyzes various tumor characteristics to assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions.

## Features

- **Data Processing**: Clean and preprocesses the dataset for accurate predictions.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Implements multiple algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides an easy-to-use web interface for inputting data and receiving predictions.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluates model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mohitkumhar/breast-cancer.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
